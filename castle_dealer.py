"""Project Euler: Problem 502 - https://projecteuler.net/problem=502

"A block is defined as a rectangle with a height of 1 and an integer-valued length.
Let a castle be a configuration of stacked blocks.

Given a game grid that is w units wide and h units tall, a castle is generated according to the following rules:

1 Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing sticks out past the edges or hangs out over open space.
2 All blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.
3 Any two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of space between them.
4 The bottom row is occupied by a block of length w.
5 The maximum achieved height of the entire castle is exactly h.
6 The castle is made from an even number of blocks.

Let F(w, h) represent the number of valid castles, given grid parameters w and h.
For example, F(4, 2) = 10, F(13, 10) = 3729050610636, F(10, 13) = 37959702514, and F(100, 100) mod 1 000 000 007 =
841913936."

Explanation of approach and rationale: This problem deals with finding permutations on a w*h grid that meet a precise
set of criteria (see 1-6 above). My proposed solution is wholly inadequate for finding (F(1012, 100) + F(10000,
10000) + F(100, 1012)) mod 1 000 000 007 - to my mind, no optimization would be enough. Due to the exponential nature
of the castle's state space, I suspect that an equation is required. This solution could even be recursive (Ã  la
Fibonnaci Sequence). However, all of my attempts to derive an equation thus far for widths / heights beyond 3 have
failed. This program is thus an exploration of the concept space in hopes of obtaining a better understanding.

The basic idea is to start from a blank slate (dimensions: 3 x 3; X := block, - := unavailable open space):


XXX

and pursue each option:
      - -    -  - -  -
XXX XX- -XX X-  -X-  -X
XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX

We maintain a list of spaces for both the current and next row, allowing constant-time building / removal
spot location. After every move, we check to see if the current configuration satisfies the 6 criteria listed above.
If it does, we add it to the sum tracked for the current iteration of the function, which is eventually returned and
added to those found by the other branches pursued in this depth-first exploration of the castle space. Since all
operations are reversible, just one global Castle can be used to complete this depth-first process.

The requisite functions are provided by the Castle class."""
